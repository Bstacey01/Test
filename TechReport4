Nintendo Switch 2 hands on impression


The Nintendo Switch 2 released this week and with it some new games! Here are the details.

The Nintendo Switch 2 offers a larger screen than its predecessor by nearly two inches, this size increase benefits the feel when holding the console in handheld mode. The new Joy-Con controllers also feel nice but only time will tell if Nintendo has fixed the Drifting issue from the previous iteration. The kickstand allowing the console to stay upright is also a big improvement as well as the new USB-C port located on the top of the console. The LCD screen is a bit disappointing when compared to the Switch 1â€™s OLED screen.

The Nintendo Switch 2 has a great opener of first party games such as Mario Kart World, and Donkey Kong Bananza as well as other titles soon to release. However, the Increased price of first party Nintendo games from $60 USD to $80 USD leaves many not feeling too optimistic.
